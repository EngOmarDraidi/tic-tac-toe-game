# Tic Tac Toe Game

An implementation of Minimax AI Algorithm on Tic-Tac-Toe game with Flutter app

## Simplified explanation of the algorithm
AI can solve games through the utilization of game trees and the minimax algorithm. These trees represent the various game states as nodes. The tree's nodes are arranged in levels corresponding to each player's turn, with the "root" node, typically depicted at the top of the diagram, representing the game's starting position. For example, in tic-tac-toe, the root node would represent the empty grid. On the second level, the nodes represent the potential game states resulting from the first player's moves, whether X or O. These nodes are known as the "children" of the root node.

## To game experiment

Clone the project

```batch
  git clone https://github.com/EngOmarDraidi/tic-tac-toe-game.git
```

Create your Flutter project then go it and copy my code inside it

```batch
  flutter create <your-project-name>
  cd <your-project-name>
  # copy my code inside it
```

To run on emulator or real device

```batch
  flutter run Or ctrl + fn + F5
```
